The CSS property `calc()` is not working as expected when used with percentages and other units.  For example, `width: calc(50% - 10px);` might not correctly subtract the 10px from 50% of the container's width in all browsers or situations.  The issue could stem from how the browser calculates percentages relative to different containing elements.
